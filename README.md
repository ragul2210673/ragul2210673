### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an engineering student at **SSN College of Engineering** (Class of 2026) with a deep-rooted passion for **Software Architecture** and system design. 

While my academic background is in Electronics, my professional focus is on designing efficient, scalable software ecosystems. I thrive on solving complex backend problems and leveraging my skills as a **Java Full Stack Developer** to build end-to-end applications. My goal is to engineer fault-tolerant systems that bridge the gap between abstract code and real-world utility.

* 🔭 **Focus:** Microservices Architecture, Distributed Systems, and Cloud DevOps.
* 🧠 **Core Competencies:** DSA, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), DBMS, and SDLC.
* ⚡ **Drive:** Transforming requirements into high-performance, deployable software.
