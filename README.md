### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineer and final-year student at SSN College of Engineering (Class of 2026), specializing Full Stack Development and System Architecture. Leveraging a strong foundation in Electronics, I focus on designing scalable, fault-tolerant software ecosystems. I bridge the gap between hardware constraints and abstract requirements to build high-performance distributed systems.

Professionally, I served as an IoT & Cloud Architect Intern at CopterCode (IIT Madras Research Park), where I engineered a real-time drone telemetry pipeline. By utilizing AWS Lambda and IoT Core, I optimized data transmission algorithms to reduce system latency by 30%.

My technical work is backed by a track record of excellence, including being a Wipro Earthian State Winner (2022) and an NPTEL Topper. Whether architecting complex backends or organizing community initiatives for Vidya Sagar, I am driven by the goal of leveraging technology to solve critical real-world problems.
