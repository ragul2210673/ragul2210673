### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an engineering student at **SSN College of Engineering** (Class of 2026) with a deep-rooted passion for **Software Architecture** and system design. While my academic background is in Electronics, my true calling lies in designing efficient, scalable software ecosystems. I operate as a **Java Full Stack Developer**, bridging the gap between abstract requirements and high-performance, fault-tolerant systems.

My professional journey is defined by hands-on engineering. During my tenure as an **IoT and Cloud Architect Intern at CopterCode (IIT Madras Research Park)**, I engineered a fault-tolerant software pipeline for drone telemetry. I utilized **AWS Lambda** and **IoT Core** to process high-velocity sensor data, optimizing algorithms to reduce latency by **30%**.

Beyond development, I strive for excellence in every domain. I am a recognized **Wipro Earthian State Winner (2022)** and an **NPTEL Topper** (IIT Madras), reflecting my commitment to both technical innovation and academic rigor. whether it's organizing events for *Vidya Sagar* or building complex backend architectures, I am driven by the goal of leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.
